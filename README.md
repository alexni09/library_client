This is a project whose main goal is to make performant queries and api requests over the web. The database has tens of millions rows; and the server responds to many requests every minute.

This project simulates a library where the user can list, borrow, return and pay for the borrowing of books.

This project includes the api, whose server is currently running on [libraryapi.site](https://libraryapi.site) [![Forge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2F24fb8ea7-22a5-426a-bc25-5cef36e4a794&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com/servers/717882/sites/2102467).

This project also includes two clients, [genericapiclient.xyz](https://genericapiclient.xyz) [![Forge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2F24fb8ea7-22a5-426a-bc25-5cef36e4a794&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com/servers/717882/sites/2102467) and [genericapi.xyz](https://genericapi.xyz) [![Forge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforge.laravel.com%2Fsite-badges%2F24fb8ea7-22a5-426a-bc25-5cef36e4a794&style=plastic)](https://forge.laravel.com/servers/717882/sites/2102467).

The api documentation is available [here](https://libraryapi.site/docs/).

*All these domain names are subject to change and they probably will; so the user is advised to check in here frequently.*

This is mainly a backend project. However, it has a monitoring page which can be accessed by clicking on the links above.

*This is the client readme.md file. For the api server readme.md file, please follow this [link](https://github.com/alexni09/library_api/blob/main/README.md).*
